# Shadow-Pac
This is a copy of what was my favourite project in uni. I had a blast making this one, that's why I'm re-uploading it to my personal repository.

## Gameplay
Essentially, this is a much simpler version of Pac-Man. It consists of only two levels and the ghosts' AI are a lot dumber; but otherwise, it's very similar to the game we all know and love.

## Dependency
This project uses Bagel. The library can be found [here](https://github.com/eleanor-em/bagel).

Shout-out to Cathy and the rest of SWEN20003 2023s1 crew for making this possible.
